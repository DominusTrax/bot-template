--  Derpy's Bot Template --

Made by DominusTrax on Github.

Hello! Welcome to Derpy's Bot Template, down below will be some information that will be important for you to know
and how to properly run the bot. I won't be giving you information on how to host the bot, hosting will be for you to find.


Important:
1st. Go to config.json and edit the fields
2nd 1/2. You can add commands by adding a file with the name of the command and adding .js to it Ex. "help.js", "ban.js", "kick.js", etc.
2nd 2/2. If you need help with how to add a command there will be a tutorial on the github page.
